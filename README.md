# Zork(Name to change)

A project where I make an open-world turn-based game playable from the terminal.

I got into coding because of my love to video games so I decided to make one. I have no experience as a game developer so I took inspiration from Zork and decided to make a game played directly on the terminal.

I aim to practice and horn my skills with this personal project.

Location Manager was implemented with graphs where each location is a node. This helped with the complexity of the location swapping algorithm.
