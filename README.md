# Zork (name to change)

A project where I make an open-world turn-based game playable from the terminal (just like zork!).

Trello: https://trello.com/b/v5ZnkSIc/zork

I got into coding because of my love to video games so I decided to make one. I have no experience as a game developer so I took inspiration from Zork and decided to make a game played directly on the terminal.

./run to play...
